The restaurant visitors share prediction with the Keras GRU and R exploration

The Keras GRU(recurrent neural network) application, Recruit Store Share Prediction Gru.ipynb, has been generated from the preprocessing data from the matrix multiplication in the explorative analysis notebook, Recruit RVF R.ipynb. 

The final submission is calculated and aseembled from the Recruit RVF R.ipynb, with the different Gru model predictions. 

The relevant datasets are from the Recruit Restaurant Visitor Forecasting.
